A REST layer over the TrueBlocks application. With `chifra serve`, you can
run this on your own machine, and make calls to local host.

## Before you begin.
* [Install the trueblocks-core application] on your machine, change your configs as needed.
* Run `chifra serve`

## How to make calls

By default, all calls are to localhost:8080. All options and flags are passed
through query parameters. Like the endpoints, the query parameters are exact
translations of the chifra cli application. These commands [have their own
documentation page](https://trueblocks.io/docs/chifra/introducing-chifra/).

For detailed descriptions of fields, see [the data model reference](/data-model/intro/intro).
