## [{NAME}]

`[{NAME}]` is a surprisingly useful tool. It allows one to associate textual names with Ethereum addresses. One may ask why this is necessary given that ENS exists. The answer is a single word: "privacy". ENS names are public. In many cases, users desire to keep personal addresses private. Try to do this on a website.

Like `chifra abis`, this tool is useful from the command line but is primarily used in support of other tools, especially `chifra export` where naming addresses becomes the single best way to turn unintellagable blockchain data into understandable information.

The various options allow you to search and filter the results. The `entities` and `tags` options are in support of the TrueBlocks explorer.

You may use the `chifra monitors` tool and the TrueBlocks explorer to manage (add, edit, delete) address-name associations.

A large collection of more than 7,500 names, gleened from various public sources, is installed with the software for your convienience. To see these publically exposed names, run `[{NAME}]` with no options.
