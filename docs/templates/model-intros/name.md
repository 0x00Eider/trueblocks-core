_Accounts_ link an address to a name.

Accounts are a combination of an`address`, a `name`, and optionally other data. Where possible, this information is queried directly from the blockchain, however in many cases the information was gathered from various websites over the years. For example, every time people say "Show me your address, and we will airdrop some tokens" on Twitter, we copy and paste all those addresses. If you're going to DOX yourselves, we're going to notice. Sorry. Not sorry.
