Transactions represent eth transfers to and from other addresses.

Most of the fields that TrueBlocks returns are standard to all eth transaction.
However, one field is very interesting: `articulatedTx` provides a human readable output of the `input` field.

This is a very powerful way to understand the story behind a smart contract.

### How to get transactions

- **CLI**:
  - run `chifra transactions <txn_id>`.
  - Use the `--articulate` option to turn the `input` field human readable.
  - [See the command's documentation](/docs/chifra/chaindata/#chifra-transactions)
- **API**:
  - [Calls to `/transactions`](/api#operation/chaindata-transactions)
