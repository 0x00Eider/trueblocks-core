Monitors are [Accounts](#account), but they have the special quality that the user has told us explicitly that they are interested in 'monitoring' the activity on the given address. He/she may do that by running either `chifra list` or `chifra export` on the address. Doing so creates a monitor for that address. See the Account data description above for information on the data fields of a monitor.

Monitors can also be [Collections](#collection) of Accounts that are similar to straight up Account monitors but monitor multiple addresses at a time.
