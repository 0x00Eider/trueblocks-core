chifra chunks  --help
Purpose:
  Manage and investigate chunks and bloom filters.

Usage:
  chifra chunks <mode> [flags] [blocks...] [address...]

Arguments:
  mode - the type of chunk info to retrieve (required)
	One of [ stats | manifest | pins | blooms | index | addresses | appearances | dump ]
  blocks - optional list of blocks to intersect with chunk ranges
  addrs - one or more addresses to use with --belongs option (see note)

Flags:
  -d, --details      for manifest and addresses options only, display full details of the report
  -c, --check        depends on mode, checks for internal consistency of the data type
  -b, --belongs      checks if the given address appears in the given chunk
  -e, --repair       valid for manifest option only, repair the given chunk (requires block number) (hidden)
  -n, --clean        retrieve all pins on Pinata, compare to manifest, remove any extraneous remote pins
  -i, --pin          make sure all chunks are pinned (locally if IPFS daemon is running, remotely with --remote flag)
  -m, --remote       for some options, force processing from remote data
  -r, --reset uint   available only in index mode, remove all chunks inclusive of or after this block (hidden)
  -u, --status       show the status of unripe, ripe, staging, blooms, and finalized folders (hidden)
  -p, --publish      update the manifest and publish it to the Unchained Index smart contract
  -x, --fmt string   export format, one of [none|json*|txt|csv|api]
  -v, --verbose      enable verbose (increase detail with --log_level)
  -h, --help         display this help screen

Notes:
  - If blocks are provided, only chunks intersecting with those blocks are displayed.
  - Only a single block in a given chunk needs to be supplied for a match.
  - The --belongs option is only available with the addresses or blooms mode.
  - The --belongs option requires both an address and a block identifier.
  - You may only specifiy an address when using the --belongs option.
  - The two --pin_ options, the --clean option, and the --check option are available only in manifest mode.
