  Purpose:  Retrieve the balance (in wei) for one or more addresses at the given block(s).

  Where:  
	addrs                 one or more addresses (0x...) from which to retrieve balances (required)
	blocks                an optional list of one or more blocks at which to report balances, defaults to 'latest'
	-m  (--mode <val>)    control which state to export, one of [none|some*|all|balance|nonce|code|storage|deployed|accttype]
	-c  (--changes)       only report a balance when it changes from one block to the next
	-n  (--no_zero)       suppress the display of zero balance accounts

#### Hidden options (shown during testing only)
	-s  (--no_history)    for testing only, hide the server's historical state
#### Hidden options (shown during testing only)

	-x  (--fmt <val>)     export format, one of [none|json*|txt|csv|api]
	-v  (--verbose)       set verbose level. Either -v, --verbose or -v:n where 'n' is level
	-h  (--help)          display this help screen

  Notes:
	- addresses must start with '0x' and be forty two characters long.
	- blocks may be a space-separated list of values, a start-end range, a special, or any combination.
	- This tool retrieves information from the local node or rpcProvider if configured (see documentation).
	- If the queried node does not store historical state, the results are undefined.
	- special blocks are detailed under whenBlock --list.
	- balance is the default mode. To select a single mode use none first, followed by that mode.
	- You may specify multiple modes on a single line.
