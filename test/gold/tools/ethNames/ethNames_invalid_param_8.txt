  Purpose:  Query addresses and/or names of well known accounts.

	terms                 a space separated list of one or more search terms (required)
	-e  (--expand)        expand search to include all fields (default searches name, address, and symbol only)

	-o  (--owned)         include personal accounts in the search
	-c  (--custom)        include your custom named accounts
	-p  (--prefund)       include prefund accounts
	-n  (--named)         include well know token and airdrop addresses in the search
	-a  (--addr)          display only addresses in the results (useful for scripting)

#### Hidden options (shown during testing only)
	-t  (--other)         export other addresses if found
	-d  (--add <str>)     add a new record to the name database (format: grp+subgrp+addr+name+sym+src+desc)
	    (--fmt <val>)     export format, one of [none|json*|txt|csv|api]
#### Hidden options (shown during testing only)

	-v  (--verbose)       set verbose level. Either -v, --verbose or -v:n where 'n' is level
	-h  (--help)          display this help screen

  Notes:
	- With a single search term, the tool searches both name and address.
	- With two search terms, the first term must match the address field, and the second term must match the name field.
	- When there are two search terms, both must match.
	- The --match_case option requires case sensitive matching. It works with all other options.
	- To customize the list of names add a custom section to the config file (see documentation).
