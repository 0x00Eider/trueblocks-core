grabABI argc: 2 [1:--help] 
grabABI --help 

  Usage:    grabABI [-c|-g|-n|-v|-h] <address> [address...]  
  Purpose:  Fetches the ABI for a smart contract. Optionally generates C++ source code representing that ABI.

  Where:  
	addrs                 list of one or more smart contracts whose ABI to grab from EtherScan (required)
	-c  (--canonical)     convert all types to their canonical represenation and remove all spaces from display
	-g  (--generate)      generate C++ code into the current folder for all functions and events found in the ABI
	-n  (--noconst)       generate encodings for non-constant functions and events only (always true when generating)

#### Hidden options (shown during testing only)
	-k  (--known)         load common 'known' ABIs from cache
#### Hidden options (shown during testing only)

	-x  (--fmt <val>)     export format, one of [none|json*|txt|csv|api]
	-v  (--verbose)       set verbose level. Either -v, --verbose or -v:n where 'n' is level
	-h  (--help)          display this help screen
