getTokenInfo --help --verbose 

  Usage:    getTokenInfo [-p|-b|-n|-v|-h] <address> <address> [address...] [block...]  
  Purpose:  Retrieve the token balance(s) for one or more addresses at the given (or latest) block(s).

  Where:  
	addrs                 two or more addresses (0x...), the first is an ERC20 token, balances for the rest are reported (required)
	blocks                an optional list of one or more blocks at which to report balances, defaults to 'latest'
	-p  (--parts <val>)   one or more parts of the token information to retreive, one or more of [none|some*|all|name|symbol|decimals|totalSupply|version]
	-b  (--by_acct)       consider each address an ERC20 token except the last, whose balance is reported for each token
	-n  (--no_zero)       suppress the display of zero balance accounts
	-v  (--verbose)       set verbose level. Either -v, --verbose or -v:n where 'n' is level
	-h  (--help)          display this help screen

  Notes:
	- addresses must start with '0x' and be forty two characters long.
	- blocks may be a space-separated list of values, a start-end range, a special, or any combination.
	- If the token contract(s) from which you request balances are not ERC20 compliant, the results are undefined.
	- If the queried node does not store historical state, the results are undefined.
	- special blocks are detailed under whenBlock --list.
