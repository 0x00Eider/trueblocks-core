# Important note: Because we use 'jq' to test that in each case we are generating valid JSON
# and because 'jq' doesn't handle 18 decimal place numbers there may be small numerical differences
# between these test cases and test cases from the command line. If one stops using 'jq' the
# numbers will be correct but then we lose the ability to know if we're generating good JSON.
