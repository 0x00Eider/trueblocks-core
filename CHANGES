## v0.40.0 - September 4, 2022

- Complete re-write of the scraper

  - more robust error handling
  - writes the IPFS hash of the spec into the header of each index file
- Wrote the version v0.40.0 of the [Unchained Index Specification](https://trueblocks.io/papers/2022/file-format-spec-v0.40.0-beta.pdf)
- Enables pinning to locally running IPFS node
- Expands the idea of Pinning Service to allow for non-Pinata providers
- Adds capability to index any chain (although we only support mainnet, sepolia, and gnosis)
- Re-wrote the Unchained Index smart contract to allow anyone to publish IPFS hashes with reasons
- Added `chifra chunks` routines to manage, clean, verify, and export index chunk data
- A lot of preparation for eventual removal of all C++ code from the code base
