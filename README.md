TrueBlocks allows you to build local-first, fully-decentralized applications using data directly from an Ethereum node. It does this through two mechanisms:

1. A lightning-fast index of every appearance of every addresses on the chain, and
2. A binary cache of only the data your application extracts. 

Local-first means your application is **private by default**, the client-side cache means your application is **fast**, and *extraction-on-demand* means your application will remain **minimal**.

[How does TrueBlocks Work?](docs/FAQ.md#how-it-works)

## Prerequisites

Before building TrueBlocks, complete these prerequisites:

#### On Linux:

```[shell]
sudo apt install build-essential git cmake python python-dev libcurl3-dev
```

#### On Mac:

```[shell]
brew install cmake
brew install git
```
## Building TrueBlocks

Currently, you must build TrueBlocks from source:

```[shell]
git clone git@github.com:TrueBlocks/trueblocks-core.git
cd trueblocks-core
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../src
make
```

This will create a series of executables in the `./bin` folder at the top of the repo. The following instructions assume you've added this folder to your `$PATH`.

## Using TrueBlocks

After building, test your configuration with this command:

```[shell]
chifra --version
```

To get a complete list of available commands, do this:

```[shell]
chifra --help --verbose
```
