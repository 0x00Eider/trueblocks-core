# quickBlocks

QuickBlocks is a collection of software libraries, applications, and tools that allow you to access Ethereum virtual machine (EVM ) based blockchain data (a) more quickly, (b) with higher information content, and (c) in an fully decentralized way, (d) in a fully automated way, (e) in a fully zero maintenance way.

Yes. That's a mouthful. We'll break it down.

## More Quickly

We interact with the Ethereum node using the RPC interface to accumulate and cache the block, transaction, receipt, and log data from the node. During the storage of this data we do everything we can think of to make later retrieval of that data as quick as possible.

1. attach receipts and logs to transactions
2. identify in-error transactions using the transaction trace function
3. store the blocks in 1,000 block files for quicker retrieval

## More Informationally Rich

If QuickBlocks is provided with an ABI definition for a particular address, the system can decode all of the transactional data including generated log files. Instead of dealing with 'hashes' and 'merkel roots' and 'sha3', you deal with the data in the format from which it was created: your own smart contract.

Instead of this:

You get this:

## Full Decentralized

Unlike any other block chain scraper you may find such as http://etherscan.io or http://chaindata.info, QuickBlocks is fully decentralized. The system interacts only with the node. As a result of this, if the node is on your own machine, so is QuickBlocks. You can disconnect your machine from the web, and as long as the node is running, QuickBlocks will work. That's decentralized.

## Fully Automatic

The code necessary to provide the above mentioned fully-parsed data (i.e. data in the language of your own smart contract) is generated automatically (programmatically) from the supplied ABI file. You do not need to write any code to monitor or interact with the data from your smart contract. At the same time, because the generated code is regular C++ code, you can interact with your data in any way you like.

## Fully Maintenance Free

The smart contract you're presumedly monitoring with QuickBlocks, once it's deployed, is immutable. That means that the automatically generated c++ code can also be immutable (if you want it to). You could literally automatically generate a data delivery layer for your smart contract that requires no further interaction. It can just stand beside your smart contract (off chain) and deliver all generated data at high speed.

## Folders

These are the folders that make up the QuickBlocks system:

1. [src](src) - source code for the QuickBlocks libraries, core applications, and sample monitors.
2. bin - location of primary executables generated by QuickBlocks
3. docs - documentation
4. test - test cases
