# TrueBlocks Core

Ethereum as it was meant to be: local-first, P2P, and accurate queries to all the data youâ€™ll ever need.

## Installing

1. A lightning-fast index of every appearance of every addresses on the chain, and

2. A binary cache of only the data your application extracts.

This is a work in progress. See [What works now?](#_what_works_now) for known issues.

## Prerequisites

---

Before building TrueBlocks, make sure you have `git`, `cmake`, `clang-format`, and `go` available.

    **For Linux**:

        sudo apt install build-essential git cmake python python-dev libcurl3-dev clang-format jq

### On Linux:

We recommend that you run MacOS Big Sur or later for best results.

### On Mac:

```[shell]
brew install cmake
brew install git
brew install clang-format
brew install jq
```

### On Windows:

We currently have no plans to support Windows builds. You may use an emulated linux system on Windows to accomplish the build. [Does TrueBlocks Work on Windows?](./docs/FAQ.md-windows)


## Building TrueBlocks

---

The only way to install TrueBlocks is to build it yourself. Follow the pre-requisites above, and then follow these instructions:

        git clone -b develop git@github.com:TrueBlocks/trueblocks-core.git
        cd trueblocks-core
        mkdir build && cd build
        cmake ../src
        make -j

This will create executables in the `./bin` folder at the top of the repo. Please make sure to add that path to your environment's `$PATH`.

## Testing Installation

---

4.  Test your install.

        chifra blocks 14560

## What even is this?

TrueBlocks creates an index that lets you access the entire Ethereum chain directly from your local machine. It ships with a large number of tools that let you chain together queries on all types of Ethereum data: transaction numbers, addresses, blocks, ABIs, et cetera.

Next, let's see if you can use TrueBlocks to extract a block from your Ethereum node. Enter this command:

Through a binary cache, TrueBlocks can make your repeated queries *very fast*. For large complex queries, this cache can reduce query times from minutes to seconds.

This should return valid JSON data for block 1,000 (type `getBlocks --help` for more options on this tool.) If you get an error, such as:

-   Data scientists

To fix this problem, first identify the location of your configuration files. On Mac, your configuration files are at `~/Library/Application Support/TrueBlocks`. On Linux, your configuration files are at `~/.local/share/trueblocks`. We call the configruation folder $CONFIG below.

To fix the missing RPC Provider issue above, edit `$CONFIG/trueBlocks.toml` and insert a valid provider. You can get a provider from various places including Infura, however, we think running your own node is best.

Enter the following text to specify a provider (add the section header if it doesn't already exist):

-   Organizations like charities who may need to process restricted donations.

Returning to your terminal, this command should now produce data:

```[shell]
chifra blocks 1000
```

You may test more thouroughly by running the following command:

### The catch

You may find that the above command show many broken tests. While not required, one of the tools (`ethslurp`) requires an API key from Etherscan. Get an EtherScan API key and add it to the same file above under the `[settings]` section thus:

```[toml]
...
etherscan_key = "<your key>"
```

## Using TrueBlocks

---

`chifra` is the basis for everything related to TrueBlocks. (The word `chifra` is derived from the Arabic word for `chipher`.) Chifra helps you decipher chain data as well as manage various aspects of the system.

Back in late 2015, we become obsessed with Ethereum. Not because of 'price go up', but because of the amazing promise that shared, global data has to change the world:

-   Permissionless data

-   World-wide consented-to data

-   Cryptographically secured data

-   Distributed data
